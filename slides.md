# Introduction: OWASP

<div class="dense">

- The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a nonprofit foundation that works to improve the security of software

- OWASP has community-led open-source software projects, hundreds of local chapters worldwide, tens of thousands of members, and leading educational and training conferences

</div>

---

# Introduction: OWASP Top Ten

<div class="dense">

- The [OWASP Top Ten](https://owasp.org/Top10/) is a standard awareness document for developers and web application security
- It represents a broad consensus about the most critical security risks to web applications

</div>

---

# Workshop Setup

<div class="dense">

- This workshop will explain each of the 10 vulnerabilities
- There is a Fastify node.js server demonstrating the security issues
- At each step you are asked to fix the vulnerability in the server
- You will find the solution to each step in the `src/a{n}-{name}` folder
- The 💡 icon indicates hints

</div>

---

# Getting setup

<div class="dense">

#### Requirements

<br />

- Node LTS
- docker
- docker-compose
- Postman (if you want to be able to test vulnerabilities)

#### Setup

<br />

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nearform/owasp-top-ten-workshop
npm ci
npm run db:up
npm run db:migrate
```

</div>

---

# Running the modules

<div class="dense">

- `cd src/a{x}-step-name`
- `npm start` will run the server ready to respond to requests
- `npm run verify` will run automated tests that fail by default until this step's issue is solved
- Check out README.md in the projects for potential additional info

</div>

### Example

```bash
cd src/a-01-access-control
npm start
```

The server for that step will run on http://localhost:3000

---

# Testing the vulnerabilities

<div class="dense">

- Some vulnerabilities involve sending specific requests to the server. We will be using the tool Postman to send those requests
- The `postman` folder contains a collection that can be imported into Postman to easily send those requests
- The Postman collection is pre-logged in with user `alice`

</div>

---

# Automated testing

<div class="dense">

- Some vulnerabilities have automated tests which verify the presence of the vulnerability
- Those tests will fail until you fix the vulnerability
- `npm run verify` in a step's folder

</div>

---

# A01: Broken Access Control

<div class="dense">

- [AO1:2021 - Broken Access Control](https://owasp.org/Top10/A01_2021-Broken_Access_Control/)
- User should only act based on specific permissions
- Incorrect permissions -> unauthorised access of data
</div>

---

# A01 Broken Access Control (2): Common vulnerabilities

<div class="dense">

- Not applying principle of least privilege
- Checks can be bypassed by tampering with page or request
- Allowing access to someone else's info by knowing the UUID
- CORS allows untrusted origins

</div>

---

# A01 Broken Access Control (3): How to Prevent

<div class="dense">

- Deny access by default
- Avoid duplication of access control logic
- Enforce user ownership when manipulating data

</div>

---

# A01 Exercise

<div class="dense">

- The `/profile` route returns sensitive user data
- It takes a `username` query parameter to return the user's info

```
GET http://localhost:3000/profile?user=alice
```

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "username": "alice",
  "age": 23
}
```

</div>

---

# A01 Exercise (2): The problem

<div class="dense">

- Run the server for step 1 (`cd src/a01-access-control`, `npm start`)
- In Postman, run the query for A01: Access Control. Observe the data for Alice being returned
- Now change the `username` query parameter to `bob`. Result:

```json
{
  "id": 2,
  "username": "bob",
  "age": 31
}
```

- Bob's data is being exposed! Remember we're logged in as Alice and shouldn't see Bob's data

</div>

---

# A01 Exercise (3): Fixing it

<div class="dense">

- Run the automated tests for step 1 - `npm run verify`
- The tests fail because the server shouldn't return Bob's data
- Edit the `/profile` route in the exercise folder to return the user's profile without exposing other people's profiles
- 💡 The server uses [fastify-jwt](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-jwt) to handle authentication

</div>

---

# A01 Exercise (4): Solution

<div class="dense">

- The issue comes from the usage of a user-supplied `query` parameter to choose which profile's info to check
- The server should instead fetch the logged-in user's info

```js
// routes/profile/index.js
export default async function user(fastify) {
  fastify.get(
    '/',
    {
      onRequest: [fastify.authenticate]
    },
    async req => {
      if (!req.user) {
        throw new errors.Unauthorized()
      }
      // We get the username from the logged in user, not from the query
      const username = req.user.username // 💡 <-- The fix is here!
      // (Skipping the rest of the function...)
      return user
    }
  )
}
//...
```

</div>

# A02: Cryptographic Failures

<div class="dense">

- [A02: Cryptographic Failures](https://owasp.org/Top10/A02_2021-Cryptographic_Failures/)
- Weak or inexistent of cryptography of sensitive data
- Passwords, credit card numbers, health records, personal information, business secrets...
- Anything protected by privacy laws or other regulations

</div>

---

# A02 Cryptographic Failures (2): Common vulnerabilities

<div class="dense">

- Weak or outdated cryptographic algorithms like md5
- Weak secret keys, default ones, keys from online tutorials, keys checked in source control...
- Lack of traffic encryption (HTTPS)
- Insufficient entropy in seed generation

</div>

---

# A02 Cryptographic Failures (3): How to Prevent

<div class="dense">

- Check sensitive data is well encrypted. Avoid storing sensitive data unnecessarily
- Use up to date and strong standard algorithms
- Proper key/secrets management (no checking private keys in git)
- Disable caching for responses that contain sensitive data

</div>

---

# A02 Exercise: a weak hashing algorithm

<div class="dense">

- The `/all-data` endpoint returns all users and their passwords (encrypted in md5). Imagine this as a data breach
- Result of the `all-data` endpoint

```json
[
  {
    "username": "bob",
    "password": "884a22eb30e5cfd71894d43ac553faa5"
  },
  {
    "username": "alice",
    "password": "5e9d11a14ad1c8dd77e98ef9b53fd1ba"
  }
]
```

</div>

---

# A02 Exercise (2): The problem

<div class="dense">

- Using the `/all-data` route, find Alice's encrypted password
- With this encrypted password hash, try to find the original unencrypted password Alice created
- the Postman collection contains requests for doing the queries
- 💡 There are websites to decrypt md5

</div>

---

# A02 Exercise (3): Fixing it

<div class="dense">

- md5 encryption is vulnerable and shouldn't be used
- In `src/a02-cryptographic-failure`, fix the encryption used to be a strong algorithm instead of md5
- Using [bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt) is a good idea for passwords
- The application exposes a `/change-password` route used to change a user's password
- Make sure the tests pass: `npm run verify`

</div>

---

# A02 Exercise (4): Solution

<div class="dense">

```js
// utils/encryption.js
const saltRounds = 10
export async function encryptPassword(password) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    bcrypt.genSalt(saltRounds, (err, salt) => {
      bcrypt.hash(password, salt, (err, hash) => {
        if (err) {
          reject(err)
        } else {
          resolve(hash)
        }
      })
    })
  })
}

export async function comparePassword(password, hash) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    bcrypt.compare(password, hash, (err, result) => {
      if (err) {
        reject(err)
      } else {
        resolve(result)
      }
    })
  })
}
```

# A03: Injection

<div class="dense">

- Injections are a form of attack where a malicious payload is able to effectively inject an arbitrary bit of query or code on the target server
- Common targets: SQL, NoSQL, ORM, LDAP, JS eval

</div>

---

# A03 Injection (2): Common vulnerabilities

<div class="dense">

- Lack of validation or sanitization of user input
- Dynamic queries or non-parameterized calls without context-aware escaping are used directly in the interpreter
- Hostile data is used within object-relational mapping (ORM) search parameters to extract additional, sensitive records

</div>

---

# A03 Injection (3): How to Prevent

<div class="dense">

- Prefer using a safe API that sanitizes input
- Escape special characters using the specific escape syntax for that interpreter
- Avoid user-supplied table names or column names as they cannot be escaped
- Use LIMIT and other statements in queries to lower the impact of injections

</div>

---

# A03 Injection Attack

TODO: Server route passing unsanitised input to an eval or something which can be exploited to drop some js variables

---

# A04: Insecure Design

<div class="dense">

- Fundamental design flaws of the software can cause security issues
- Those issues cannot be fixed by a better more secure code implementation
- Failure to determine the clevel of security design required during design

</div>

---

# A04 Insecure Design: Examples

<div class="dense">

- A forgotten password flow with "security questions" is insecure by design because more than one person can know the answer
- An ecommerce website sells high-end video cards that scalpers buy with bots to resell, causing bad PR with customers. Most websites wouldn't need to design against bots, but due to the nature of the product being sold this one does
- A cinema chain allows booking up to fifteen attendees before requiring a deposit. An attacker could make hundreds of small booking requests at once to block all seats, causing massive revenue loss

</div>

# A04 Insecure Design: How to prevent

<div class="dense">

- Model threats for the application, all its flows and business logic
- Continuously evaluate security requirement and design during the development lifecycle
- Consider security rules and access controls for every user story
- Use unit and integration tests to verify the application is resistant to the threat model

</div>

---

# A05: Security Misconfiguration

<div class="dense">

- Badly configured servers or services can lead to vulnerabilities
- With increased usage of highly configurable software and cloud APIs, there are many opportunities for misconfiguration

</div>

---

# A05 Security Misconfiguration: Common Vulnerabilities

<div class="dense">

- Improperly configured permissions on cloud services
- Unnecessary features enabled: open ports, services, accounts with elevated accesss...
- Default credentials unchanged
- Out of date or vulnerable server
- Stack trace from error handling revealing information to users

</div>

---

# A05 Security Misconfiguration: How to prevent

<div class="dense">

- Repeatable, automated and fast to deploy environments lower risk of creating insecure environments or deployments
- Different credentials should be used in each environment
- Frequently review security updates, patches and permissions
- A segmented architecture increases security by separating components, tenants, containers or cloud security groups
- Automated testing against the configuration of all environments

</div>

---

# A06: Vulnerable and Outdated Components

<div class="dense">

- Applications use a variety of components and libraries which can have security issues
- Vulnerable components can be an attack vector until they are patched
- Particularly relevant in the node.js world with an ever-growing NPM dependency tree

</div>

---

# A06 Vulnerable and Outdated Components: Common Vulnerabilities

<div class="dense">

- Not tracking versions of used components, including nested dependencies
- Using unsupported or vulnerable software, including OS, web server, database, APIs, libraries, components, runtimes...
- Not scanning for vulnerabilities regularly and subscribing to security news for used components
- Not fixing vulnerable dependencies in a timely fashion

</div>

---

# A07: Identification and Authentication Failures

<div class="dense">

- Verification of the user's identity is crucial to security
- Weak or vulnerable authentication systems can be attacked to gain access

</div>

---

# A07 Identification and Authentication Failures: Common Vulnerabilities

<div class="dense">

- Application allows brute forcing of credentials
- Allows default, weak or known passwords
- Exploitable credential recovery processes
- Lack of effective multi-factor authentication
- Unencrypted or weakly encrypted password storage

</div>

---

# A07 Identification and Authentication Failures: How to prevent

<div class="dense">

-

</div>

---

# A08: Software and Data Integrity Failures

<div class="dense">

- Code and infrastructure not protected against integrity violations
- Attackers gaining access to a plugin and deploy an unverified update which would get distributed to all its users

</div>

---

# A08 Software and Data Integrity Failures: Common Vulnerabilities

<div class="dense">

- Libraries coming from untrusted sources, repos or CDNs
- An insecure CI/CD pipeline
- Updates downloaded without sufficient integrity verification

</div>

---

# A08 Software and Data Integrity Failures: How to prevent

<div class="dense">

- Using digital signatures for integrity checks on data and downloaded software
- Ensure npm dependencies are trusted. For higher risks, host a custom repository of packages with internally vetted dependencies
- Use automated tools to verify that components don't contain known vulnerabilities
- Ensure there are code reviews for changes to minimise the risk of malicious code being introduced

</div>

---

# A09: Security Logging and Monitoring Failures

<div class="dense">

- Proper logging and monitoring is critical to detecting and responding to breaches
- It is important for alerting, accountability, visibility and forensics of security incidents

</div>

---

# A10: Server Side Request Forgery

<div class="dense">

</div>

---

# Beyond the Top 10

<div class="dense">

- The OWASP Top 10 is a good introduction to the most common issues to keep in mind while developing
- By its nature, the Top 10 is a series of guidelines but can't be tested easily as its applications are broad
- On the other hand the [OWASP Application Security Verification Standard](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/) is a comprehensive list of security criteria
- Those are specific, standardised and verifiable security requirements on which on app can be tested to either pass or fail

</div>

---

# Other useful OWASP resources

<div class="dense">

- The [OWASP Cheat Sheet Series](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org) provides condensed information on specific security topics related to OWASP standards
- The [OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model](https://owaspsamm.org) can help an organization analyze and improve their software security
