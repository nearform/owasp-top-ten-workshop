# Introduction: OWASP üêù

<div class="dense">

- The Open Web Application Security Project (**OWASP**) is a **non profit** foundation that works to improve the security of software

- OWASP has community-led **open-source** software projects, hundreds of local chapters worldwide, tens of thousands of members, and leading educational and training conferences

</div>

---

# Introduction: OWASP Top Ten

<div class="dense">

- The **[OWASP Top Ten](https://owasp.org/Top10/)** is a standard awareness document for developers and web application security
- It represents a broad consensus about the most critical security risks to web applications

</div>

---

# Workshop Setup

<div class="dense">

- This workshop will explain each of the 10 vulnerabilities
- There is a Fastify node.js server demonstrating the security issues
- At each step you are asked to fix the vulnerability in the server
- You will find the solution to each step in the file `solution.js` inside `src/a{n}-{name}` folder (the actual path may vary)
- The üí° icon indicates hints

</div>

---

# Getting setup

<div class="dense">

#### Requirements

<br />

- Node LTS
- docker
- docker-compose
- Postman (if you want to be able to test vulnerabilities)

#### Setup

<br />

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nearform/owasp-top-ten-workshop
npm ci
npm run db:up
npm run db:migrate
```

</div>

---

# Running the modules

<div class="dense">

- `cd src/a{x}-step-name`
- `npm start` will run the server ready to respond to requests
- `npm run verify` will run automated tests that fail by default until this step's issue is solved
- Check out README.md in the projects for potential additional info

</div>

### Example

```bash
cd src/a01-access-control
npm start
```

The server for that step will run on http://localhost:3000

---

# Testing the vulnerabilities

<div class="dense">

- Some vulnerabilities involve sending specific requests to the server. We will be using the tool Postman to send those requests
- The `postman` folder contains a collection that can be imported into Postman to easily send those requests
- The Postman collection is pre-logged in with user `alice`. The `Bearer token` is set that represents `alice`.

</div>

---

# Automated testing

<div class="dense">

- Some vulnerabilities have automated tests which verify the presence of the vulnerability
- Those tests will fail until you fix the vulnerability
- `npm run verify` in a step's folder

</div>

---

# A01 Broken Access Control

<div class="dense">

- [AO1:2021 - Broken Access Control](https://owasp.org/Top10/A01_2021-Broken_Access_Control/)
- User should only act based on specific permissions
- Incorrect permissions -> unauthorised access of data
</div>

---

# A01 Common vulnerabilities

<div class="dense">

- Not applying principle of **least privilege**
- Checks can be bypassed by tampering with page or request
- Allowing access to someone else's info by knowing the UUID
- CORS allows untrusted origins

</div>

---

# A01 How to Prevent

<div class="dense">

- Deny access by default
- Avoid duplication of access control logic
- Enforce **user ownership** when manipulating data

</div>

---

# A01 Exercise

<div class="dense">

- The `/profile` route returns sensitive user data
- It takes a `username` query parameter to return the user's info

```
GET http://localhost:3000/profile?username=alice
```

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "username": "alice",
  "age": 23
}
```

</div>

---

# A01 The problem

<div class="dense">

- Run the server for step 1 (`cd src/a01-access-control`, `npm start`)
- In Postman, run the query for A01: Access Control. Observe the data for Alice being returned
- Now change the `username` query parameter to `bob`. Result:

```json
{
  "id": 2,
  "username": "bob",
  "age": 31
}
```

- Bob's data is being exposed! Remember we're logged in as Alice and shouldn't see Bob's data

</div>

---

# A01 Fixing it ü™Ñ

<div class="dense">

- Run the automated tests for step 1 - `npm run verify`
- The tests fail because the server shouldn't return Bob's data
- Edit the `/profile` route in the exercise folder to return only the `logged-in` user's profile without exposing other people's profiles
- üí° The server uses [fastify-jwt](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-jwt) to handle authentication

</div>

---

# A01 Solution üí°

<div class="dense">

- The issue comes from the usage of a user-supplied `query` parameter to choose which profile's info to check
- The server should instead fetch the only the `logged-in` user's info and reply with `403` in other cases

```js
async req => {
  if (!req.user) {
    throw new errors.Unauthorized()
  }
  const username = req.user.username // üí° We get the username from the logged in user, not from the query!
  if (username !== req.query.username) {
    throw new errors.Forbidden() // if does not match with the user's one, return a 403 Forbidden error
  }
  return user
}
```

</div>

---

# A02 Cryptographic Failures

<div class="dense">

- [A02: Cryptographic Failures](https://owasp.org/Top10/A02_2021-Cryptographic_Failures/)
- Weak or inexistent **cryptography** of sensitive data
- Passwords, credit card numbers, health records, personal information, business secrets...
- Anything protected by privacy laws or other regulations

</div>

---

# A02 Common vulnerabilities

<div class="dense">

- Weak or outdated cryptographic algorithms like **md5 ‚ö†Ô∏è**
- Weak secret keys, default ones, keys from online tutorials, keys checked in source control...
- Lack of traffic encryption (**HTTPS**)
- Insufficient entropy in seed generation

</div>

---

# A02 How to Prevent

<div class="dense">

- Check sensitive data is well **encrypted**. Avoid storing sensitive data unnecessarily
- Use up to date and strong standard algorithms
- Proper key/secrets management (**private keys in git ‚ö†Ô∏è**)
- Disable caching for responses that contain sensitive data

</div>

---

# A02 A weak hashing algorithm

<div class="dense">

- The `/all-data` endpoint returns all users and their passwords (hashed using md5). Imagine this as a data breach
- Result of the `all-data` endpoint

```json
[
  {
    "username": "bob",
    "password": "884a22eb30e5cfd71894d43ac553faa5"
  },
  {
    "username": "alice",
    "password": "5e9d11a14ad1c8dd77e98ef9b53fd1ba"
  }
]
```

</div>

---

# A02 The problem

<div class="dense">

- Using the `/all-data` route, find Alice's hashed password
- With this password hash, try to find the original password Alice created
- the Postman collection contains requests for doing the queries
- üí° There are websites to decrypt md5

</div>

---

# A02 Fixing it ü™Ñ

<div class="dense">

- md5 hash is vulnerable and shouldn't be used
- In `src/a02-cryptographic-failure`, fix the hashing algorithm used to be a strong algorithm instead of md5
- Using [bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt) is a good idea for passwords
- The application exposes a `/change-password` route used to change a user's password

</div>

---

# A02 Solution üí°

<div class="dense">

```js
// utils/crypto.js
import { hash, compare } from 'bcrypt'

const saltRounds = 10

export async function hashPassword(password) {
  return await hash(password, saltRounds)
}
```

</div>

---

# A02 Solution üí° (2)

<div class="dense">

```js
// utils/crypto.js
export async function comparePassword(password, hash) {
  return await compare(password, hash)
}
```

</div>

---

# A03 Injection üíâ

<div class="dense">

- [A03: Injection](https://owasp.org/Top10/A03_2021-Injection/)
- Injections are a form of attack where a malicious payload is able to effectively inject an arbitrary bit of query or code on the target server
- Injections can result in data loss or corruption, lack of accountability, or denial of access. Injections can sometimes lead to complete host takeover.
- Common targets: **SQL, NoSQL, ORM, LDAP, JS eval**

</div>

---

# A03 Common vulnerabilities

<div class="dense">

- Lack of validation or **sanitization** of user input
- Dynamic queries or non-parameterized calls without context-aware **escaping** are used directly in the interpreter
- Hostile data is used within object-relational mapping (ORM) **search parameters** to extract additional, sensitive records

</div>

---

# A03 Attack

<div class="dense">

- Run the server for step 3 (`cd src/a03-injection`, `npm start`)
- In Postman, run the query for `A03: Get customer by name`. Observe the data for `name: "alice"` being returned
- Try to run the query for `A03: SQL Injection`. Observe all the customers being returned
- The query param value `' OR '1'='1` takes advantage of the unsafe string concatenation to create this SQL query
  `SELECT * FROM customers WHERE name='' OR '1'='1'` which will return every record in the table

</div>

---

# A03 Fixing it ü™Ñ

<div class="dense">

- üí° Prefer using a safe API that **sanitizes input** e.g `@nearform/sql`
- **Escape special characters** using the specific escape syntax for that interpreter
- Avoid user-supplied table names or column names as they cannot be escaped
- **Automated testing** of all parameters, headers, URL, cookies, JSON, SOAP, and XML data inputs is strongly encouraged

</div>

---

# A03 Solution üí°

<div class="dense">

- The `@nearform/sql` library escapes special characters contained in the user's input

```js
// import SQL from '@nearform/sql'
export default async function customer(fastify) {
  fastify.get(
    '/customer',
    {
      onRequest: [fastify.authenticate]
    },
    async req => {
      const { name } = req.query
      const { rows: customers } = await fastify.pg.query(
        SQL`SELECT * FROM customers WHERE name=${name}`
      )
      if (!customers.length) throw errors.NotFound()
      return customers
    }
  )
}
```

</div>

---

# A04 Insecure Design

<div class="dense">

- [A04: Insecure Design](https://owasp.org/Top10/A04_2021-Insecure_Design/)
- Fundamental **design flaws** of the software can cause security issues
- Those issues cannot be fixed by a better more secure code implementation
- Failure to determine the level of security required during design

</div>

---

# A04 Examples

<div class="dense">

- A forgotten password flow with **_"security questions"_** is insecure by design because more than one person can know the answer
- An ecommerce website sells high-end video cards that scalpers buy with bots to resell (bad PR with customers)
- A cinema chain allows booking up to fifteen attendees before requiring a deposit. An attacker could make **hundreds of small booking requests** at once to block all seats, causing massive revenue loss

</div>

---

# A04 How to prevent

<div class="dense">

- Model threats for the application, all its flows and business logic
- Continuously evaluate security requirement and design during the development lifecycle
- Consider security rules and access controls for every user story
- **Use unit and integration tests** to verify the application is resistant to the threat model

</div>

---

# A04 Exercise

<div class="dense">

- The `/buy-product` endpoint does not have protection against bots run by scalpers
- It means that someone can buy a lot of stock quickly and leave legitimate customers without any

</div>

---

# A04 Scalping

<div class="dense">

- Run the server for step 4 (`cd src/a04-insecure-design`, `npm start`)
- In Postman, run the query for `A04: Buy product`. Observe the data for `success: true` being returned
- Run the query many times in a row in a short period of time
- Notice that there is no protection against multiple sequential purchases
</div>

---

# A04 Fixing it ü™Ñ

<div class="dense">

- Prefer using rate limiter for your routes
- üí° Using [`fastify-rate-limit`](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-rate-limit) is a good idea for setting a rate limit
- Let's consider a scenario where a user can buy a maximum of two products per minute
- Edit the `/buy-product` route in the exercise folder considering the scenario above

</div>

---

# A04 Solution üí°

<div class="dense">

```js
// register the rateLimit plugin in the server.js file
await fastify.register(rateLimit)
```

```js
// the rate limit is set to a maximum of two purchases per minute
export default async function ecommerce(fastify) {
  fastify.post(
    '/buy-product',
    {
      config: {
        rateLimit: {
          max: 2,
          timeWindow: '1 minute'
        }
      }
    },
    (req, reply) => {
      reply.send({ success: true })
    }
  )
}
```

</div>

---

# A05 Security Misconfiguration

<div class="dense">

- Security misconfigurations are security controls that are inaccurately configured or left insecure, putting your systems and data at risk
- **Badly configured** servers or services can lead to vulnerabilities
- With increased usage of highly configurable software and cloud APIs, there are many opportunities for misconfiguration

</div>

---

# A05 Common Vulnerabilities

<div class="dense">

- Improperly configured **permissions** or security settings
- Unnecessary features enabled: open ports, services, accounts with elevated accesss...
- **Default credentials** unchanged
- Out of date or vulnerable server
- Stack trace from error handling revealing information to users

</div>

---

# A05 How to prevent

<div class="dense">

- Repeatable, automated and fast to deploy environments
- Different credentials should be used in each environment
- Frequently review security updates, patches and permissions
- A **segmented architecture** increases security by separating components, tenants, containers or cloud security groups
- An automated **test** to verify the effectiveness of the configurations

</div>

---

# A05 Unsigned Cookies üç™

<div class="dense">

- Run the server for step 5 (`cd src/a05-security-misconfiguration`, `npm start`)
- In Postman, run the query for `A05: Login`. Observe a cookie with `userId=1` being returned
- Try to run the query for `A05: Profile`. Observe the information about profile with `userId=1` being returned
- Try to [change the value of the cookie](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/cookies/) to `userId=2`. Observe information about `userId=2` being returned

</div>

---

# A05 Fixing it ü™Ñ

<div class="dense">

- üí° Cookie must always be **[signed](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-cookie)** to ensure they are not getting tampered with on client-side by an attacker
- It's important to use **httpOnly** cookies to prevent the cookie being accessed through client side script
- Store the **signing secret** safely.
- Don't store sentive information in cleartext

</div>

---

# A05 Solution üí°

<div class="dense">

```js
export function login(fastify) {
  fastify.post('/login', { schema }, async (req, rep) => {
    const { username, password } = req.body
    const {
      rows: [user]
    } = await fastify.pg.query(
      SQL`SELECT id, username, password FROM users WHERE username = ${username}`
    )
    if (!user) {
      throw errors.Unauthorized('No matching user found')
    }
    const passwordMatch = await comparePassword(password, user.password)
    if (!passwordMatch) {
      throw errors.Unauthorized('Invalid Password')
    }
    rep.setCookie('userId', JSON.stringify(user.id), {
      signed: true, // üí° signing the cookie
      httpOnly: true // http only
    })
    return 'user logged in'
  })
}
```

</div>

---

# A05 Solution üí° (2)

<div class="dense">

```js
export function profile(fastify) {
  fastify.get('/profile', async req => {
    const { value: id, valid } = fastify.unsignCookie(
      //unsign the cookie and check validity
      req?.cookies?.userId || ''
    )

    if (!valid) {
      // check if the cookie has been tampered
      throw new errors.Unauthorized()
    }
    const {
      rows: [user]
    } = await fastify.pg.query(
      SQL`SELECT id, username, age FROM users WHERE id = ${id}`
    )
    if (!user) {
      throw new errors.NotFound()
    }
    return user
  })
}
```

</div>

# A06 Vulnerable and Outdated Components

<div class="dense">

- Applications use a variety of components and libraries which can have security issues
- Vulnerable components can be an attack vector until they are patched
- Particularly relevant in the node.js world with an ever-growing **NPM dependency tree**

</div>

---

# A06 Common Vulnerabilities

<div class="dense">

- Not **tracking versions** of used components, including nested dependencies
- Using unsupported or vulnerable software, including OS, web server, database, APIs, libraries, components, runtimes...
- Not **scanning for vulnerabilities** regularly and subscribing to security news for used components
- Not fixing vulnerable dependencies in a timely fashion

</div>

---

# A06 How to prevent

<div class="dense">

- Remove **unused dependencies**, unnecessary features, components, files, and documentation
- Continuously inventory the versions of components and their dependencies
- Monitor for libraries and components that are **unmaintained** or do not create security patches for older versions
- Only obtain components from **official** sources over secure links

</div>

---

# A06 The attack ü•∑

<div class="dense">

- Run the server for step 6 (`cd src/a06-vulnerable-outdated`, `npm start`)
- In Postman, run the query for `A06: Profile`. Observe error `404` being returned
- Try to run the query for `A06: Exploit vulnerability`. Observe the error message response
</div>

---

# A06 The attack (2)

<div class="dense">

- Because of an outdated version of the HTTP client library **[undici](https://github.com/nodejs/undici)** we can exploit a known **[vulnerability](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2022-35949/)**
- By passing the value `//127.0.0.1` in the username query param, we override the original hostname and we can make the server perform a GET to `127.0.0.1:80`
</div>

---

# A06 Fixing it ü™Ñ

<div class="dense">

- üí° Update the library to a version in which this vulnerability was fixed

</div>

---

# A06 The Solution üí°

<div class="dense">

```js
import { request } from 'undici' //üí° updated undici version >= 5.8.1
export default function (fastify) {
  fastify.get(
    '/profile',
    {
      onRequest: [fastify.authenticate]
    },
    async req => {
      const { username } = req.query
      if (/^\//.test(username)) {
        // check username doesn't start with /
        throw errors.BadRequest()
      }
      const { body, statusCode } = await request({
        origin: 'http://example.com',

      })
      if (statusCode !== 200) {
        throw errors.NotFound()
      }
      return body
    }
  )
}
```

</div>

# A07 Identification and Authentication Failures

<div class="dense">

- Verification of the user's identity, **authentication**, and session management is crucial to security
- Weak or vulnerable authentication systems can be exploited to gain access
- Systems with broken authentication can lead to data breaches and passwords leak

</div>

---

# A07 Common Vulnerabilities

<div class="dense">

- Application allows for credentials stuffing or brute forcing
- Allows default, weak or known passwords
- Exploitable credential recovery processes
- Lack of effective **multi-factor authentication**
- Unencrypted or weakly encrypted **password storage**

</div>

---

# A07 How to prevent

<div class="dense">

- Where possible, implement **multi-factor authentication**
- Require **strong passwords** (length, complexity, rotation policies, and don't allow leaked passwords use)
- Ensure registration and credential recovery use the same messages for all outcomes
- Limit or increasingly delay failed login attempts
- Use secure password data store practices (salting + hashing)

</div>

---

# A07 Allowing leaked passwords üíß

<div class="dense">

- In 2017 the NIST **[recommended](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html#sec4:~:text=when%20processing%20requests,a%20different%20value)** that websites should check all new passwords against available lists of data breaches.
- This practice has been adopted by OWASP and became part of their **[recommendation](<https://owasp.org/Top10/A07_2021-Identification_and_Authentication_Failures/#:~:text=Align%20password%20length%2C%20complexity%2C%20and%20rotation%20policies%20with%20National%20Institute%20of%20Standards%20and%20Technology%20(NIST)%20800%2D63b%27s%20guidelines%20in%20section%205.1.1%20for%20Memorized%20Secrets%20or%20other%20modern%2C%20evidence%2Dbased%20password%20policies.>)**.
- In the real scenario you should try to use something like **[Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords)**

</div>

---

# A07 Allowing leaked passwords üíß (2)

<div class="dense">

- In the workshop - the database contains the list of leaked passwords in `databreachrecords`
- Run the server for step 7 (`cd src/a07-authentication-failures`, `npm start`)
- In Postman, run the query for `A07: Register`. Observe a token is succesfully returned
- In the database check the `databreachrecords` table for password used in the Postman request body

</div>

---

# A07 Allowing leaked passwords üíß (3)

<div class="dense">

- It should not allow to use passwords that are known to be leaked
- Instead it should require the user to set a different password indicating what is the reason
- Place your solution in the `routes/user/index.js`
- Test it by running `npm run verify` (it will fail initially)

</div>

---

# A07 Fixing it ü™Ñ

<div class="dense">

- üí° Using data available in `dataBreachRecords` check if requested password is safe to use
- Run `sql` query inside the `/register` endpoint to check if the password is there
- Return a `400` error with `message` indicating the source of the leak: `'You are trying to use password that is known to be exposed in data breaches: ${source}. Use a different one. Read more here: https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords.'`

</div>

---

# A07 Solution üí°

<div class="dense">

# A08 Software and Data Integrity Failures

<div class="dense">

- Code and infrastructure not protected against **integrity violations**
- Attackers gaining access to a plugin and deploy an unverified update which would get distributed to all its users

</div>

---

# A08 Common Vulnerabilities

<div class="dense">

- Libraries coming from **untrusted sources**, repos or CDNs
- Deserialization of Untrusted Data, where objects or data are encoded or serialized into a structure that an attacker can see and modify is vulnerable to **insecure deserialization**
- An insecure CI/CD pipeline
- Updates downloaded without sufficient integrity verification

</div>

---

# A08 How to prevent

<div class="dense">

- Using digital signatures for integrity checks on data and downloaded software
- Ensure **npm dependencies** are trusted. For higher risks, host a custom repository of packages with internally vetted dependencies
- Use automated tools to verify that components don't contain known vulnerabilities
- Ensure there are code reviews for changes to minimise the risk of malicious code being introduced

</div>

---

# A08 Exercise: Insecure Deserialization

<div class="dense">

- Run the server for step 8 (`cd src/a08-software-data-integrity-failures`, `npm start`)
- In Postman, try to run the query for `A08: Get profile from cookie`. There is a cookie attached to the request `/profile` containing the user's profile encoded as base64. Observe the request `status code 500` being returned
- This is happening because the server is deserializing a `cookie containing a malicious JavaScript` code which is forcing the server to throw an exception

</div>

---

# A08 Exercise: Insecure Deserialization

<div class="dense">

- When decoding the cookie attached to the `/profile` request, this is what the output looks like:

```javascript
// base64 to ASCII
{
  id: 1,
  username:
    "_$$ND_FUNC$$_function () {\n    throw new Error('server error')\n  }()"
}
```

- Note that there is an `IIFE` at the end of the username key, and this causes the function to run on the server as it is doing an insecure deserialization
- The full step by step to serialize a JavaScript code and inject it as a cookie can be found [in this article](https://opsecx.com/index.php/2017/02/08/exploiting-node-js-deserialization-bug-for-remote-code-execution/)

</div>

---

# A08 Fixing it ü™Ñ

<div class="dense">

- Run the automated tests for step 8 - `npm run verify`
- The tests fail because the server shouldn't trust a library that provides a way to deserialize strings into executable JavaScript code
- Untrusted data passed into `unserialize()` function in `node-serialize` module can be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution by passing a serialized JavaScript Object with an Immediately invoked function expression (IIFE)
- üí° `JSON.parse` is a safer way to deserialize data

</div>

---

# A08 Solution üí°

<div class="dense">

```js
export default async function solution(fastify) {
  fastify.get('/profile', req => {
    const cookieAsStr = Buffer.from(req.cookies.profile, 'base64').toString(
      'ascii'
    )

    const profile = JSON.parse(cookieAsStr)

    if (profile.username) {
      return 'Hello ' + profile.username
    }

    return 'Hello guest'
  })

- Proper logging and monitoring is **critical** to detecting and responding to breaches
- It is important for alerting, accountability, visibility and forensics of security incidents

</div>

# A09 Common Vulnerabilities

<div class="dense">

- Auditable events, such as logins, failed logins, and **high-value transactions**, are not logged
- Warnings and errors generate no, inadequate, or unclear log messages
- Logs of applications and APIs are not monitored for **suspicious activity**
- The application cannot detect, escalate, or alert for active attacks in real-time or near real-time

</div>

---

# A09 How to prevent

<div class="dense">

- Ensure all login, access control, and server-side input validation failures can be logged with **sufficient user context** to identify suspicious or malicious accounts
- Ensure log data is encoded correctly to prevent injections or attacks on the logging or monitoring systems
- Ensure high-value transactions have an audit trail with integrity controls to prevent tampering or deletion, such as append-only database tables or similar.

</div>

# A09 Suspicious activity ü§®

<div class="dense">

- Run the server for step 5 (`cd src/a09-security-logging`, `npm run verify`)
- You can observe a log message `something suspicious is happening`
- Note that the application is using a vulnerable version of the http client **[undici](https://github.com/nodejs/undici/security/advisories/GHSA-f772-66g8-q5h3)**

# A09 Fixing it ü™Ñ

<div class="dense">

- üí° Log user input to identify suspicious or malicious access
- Validate user input

</div>

---

# A09 Solution üí°

<div class="dense">

```js
// profile route handler

async req => {
  console.log({
    username: req.user.username, // add context to logs to help identify the user
    input: req.headers['content-type']
  })
  const headerCharRegex = /[^\t\x20-\x7e\x80-\xff]/ // validate user input
  if (headerCharRegex.exec(req.headers['content-type']) !== null) {
    throw errors.BadRequest()
  }
  const { body } = await request('http://localhost:3001', {
    method: 'GET',
    headers: {
      'content-type': req.headers['content-type']
    }
  })
  return body
}
```

# A10 Server Side Request Forgery

<div class="dense">

- SSRF flaws occur whenever a web application is fetching a remote resource without **validating** the user-supplied URL
- It allows an attacker to coerce the application to send a crafted request to an **unexpected destination**, even when protected by a firewall, VPN, or another type of network access control list

</div>

---

# A10 How to prevent

<div class="dense">

- **Sanitize and validate** all client-supplied input data
- Enforce the URL schema, port, and destination with a positive allow list
- Do not send raw responses to clients
- Disable HTTP redirections
- ‚ùó Do not mitigate SSRF via the use of a deny list or regular expression

</div>

---

# A10 The Attack ü•∑

<div class="dense">

- Run the server for step 10 (`cd src/a10-server-side-request-forgery`, `npm start`)
- In Postman, run the query for `A10: Upload Image`. Observe an image being returned
- Try to run the query for `A10: Malicious Image url`. Observe `something suspicious is happening` being returned
- The server is not sanitizing user input so it will send a request to whatever url provided in the payload

</div>

---

# A10 Fixing it ü™Ñ

<div class="dense">

- Sanitize the url making sure it's valid
- Create a whitelist of allowed domains by adding them in the database column `allowedImageDomain`
- üí° Make sure the requested domain is in the whitelist

</div>

---

# A10 Solution üí°

<div class="dense">

```js
export default async function profilePicture(fastify) {
  fastify.post(
    '/user/image',
    {
      onRequest: [fastify.authenticate]
    },
    async req => {
      const { imgUrl } = req.body
      const url = validateUrl(imgUrl) // validate url using the URL object
      const {
        rows: [whitelisted]
      } = await fastify.pg.query(
        SQL`SELECT * FROM allowedImageDomain WHERE hostname = ${url.hostname}`
      )
      if (!whitelisted) {
        throw errors.Forbidden()
      }
      const { data } = await axios.get(url.href)
      return data
    }
  )
}
```

# Beyond the Top 10

<div class="dense">

- The OWASP Top 10 is a good introduction to the most common issues to keep in mind while developing
- By its nature, the Top 10 is a series of guidelines but can't be tested easily as its applications are broad
- On the other hand the [OWASP Application Security Verification Standard](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/) is a comprehensive list of security criteria
- Those are specific, standardised and verifiable security requirements on which on app can be tested to either pass or fail

</div>

# Other useful OWASP resources

<div class="dense">

- The [OWASP Cheat Sheet Series](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org) provides condensed information on specific security topics related to OWASP standards
- The [OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model](https://owaspsamm.org) can help an organization analyze and improve their software security
